# Weatherlady

## Brief description of the system

As part of the project, a system should be created to collect data from one or preferably two/three weather services (or use files) and provide the average (the result should be a given weather value calculated as the arithmetic average of the results returned by each service) values calculated on the basis of the responses returned.

## edu.weatherlady.Main system functions

* Downloading weather data from relevant web services (or files on your local disc)
* Downloaded data should be saved to the database
* The application should use the city date and location to retrieve average values
* Average results should be saved in the database

### Technologies
* Console application
* JDBC or Hibernate
* Domain logic divided into layers, eg DAO, Service
* Unit testing tools

### Optionally:
* Http client, e.g. HttpClient, OkHttp
* Application presentation layer based on a pattern, eg MVC/MVP
* JSON data serialization/deserialization tool, eg Gson, Jackson
* dependency injection framework, such as Guice
* JavaFX based frontend

## Functionalities

### User Interface

Within the console/graphic view, the user should be able to select one of the following options:

* adding specific locations to the database
* displaying currently added locations
* downloading weather values

### Adding a location

The user should be able to add a location to the database by entering the following values:

* id
* longitude and latitude
* region
* country name

Additionally, as part of the task, the user should ensure appropriate validation:

* id - optional: UUID format
* longitude and latitude according to geographical values ​​(latitude: -90 -> S, 90 -> N, longitude: -180 -> W, 180 -> E)
* city name - cannot be empty
* region - optional: may be null
* Country name - cannot be empty

If incorrect data are entered, the user should be notified via an appropriate message.

### Display of available locations

By selecting the menu option, the user should be able to see all locations entered into the database.

### Downloading weather data

#### Downloading weather data from external services

Under this option, the user should be able to download data from e.g. the following systems:

* https://openweathermap.org/api
* https://developer.accuweather.com/apis
* https://weatherstack.com/documentation

#### Supported parameters

The user should be able to retrieve the following values:

* temperature
* pressure
* humidity
* wind direction and speed

Values taken from external websites should be averaged and saved additionally to the database before being returned to the user.

#### Available download configurations

The user can indicate the following values via the application:

`DATE`

The request may indicate the date on which the weather is to be checked. If the user does not enter the date in the agreed format, the weather for tomorrow should be checked.

`LOCATION`

The request may indicate the location for which the values should be returned. The location should be able to be communicated as city name or a geographic coordinate. Before using it, the location should be saved in the database.

### Optional functionalities

#### Edit location

As part of the new menu option, the user should be able to edit the currently added locations. Validation should also be included in the edit.

#### Location search

The user should be able to display information about a specific location by searching for it, e.g. by name.

#### Statistic data

The user should be able to display statistical data on selected weather values ​​from a specific time period, e.g. month, year. Data for this purpose should be downloaded directly from the database.

#### Data write/read

The user should be able to save the currently collected data to a file in any format, and then restore them by saving directly to the database.

## Unit tests

The implemented functionalities should be covered with unit tests in accordance with commonly used methodologies and practices.

> Please note that, most probably, you will not be able to write tests for all classes because topics related with mocking has not yet been covered.

### Additional requirements

The program should meet the following criteria:

* functionality
* code quality (transparency, maintainability, structure)
* use of the latest technologies (at least the latest stable version of JDK, the latest stable versions of libraries)
* user experience
* reliability

The task is formulated very generally on purpose. If something is not specified, it can be implemented in a way that is convenient for the student. There are no preferred solutions or technologies other than those listed.
